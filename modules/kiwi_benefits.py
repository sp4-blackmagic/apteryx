    Kiwi fruit is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients and health-promoting compounds. Here are some science-backed reasons to include more kiwi in your diet:
    
    ### 1. High in Vitamin C and Antioxidants
    - Kiwi is one of the richest sources of vitamin C, which supports immune function and acts as a powerful antioxidant.
    - [Carr, A. C., & Frei, B. (1999). Toward a new recommended dietary allowance for vitamin C based on antioxidant and health effects. *The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition*, 69(6), 1086-1107.](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/69/6/1086/4714977)
    
    ### 2. Supports Digestive Health
    - Kiwi contains actinidin, an enzyme that aids protein digestion, and is high in fiber, which promotes gut health.
    - [Rush, E. C., Patel, M., & Plank, L. D. (2002). Kiwifruit promotes laxation in the elderly. *Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition*, 11(2), 164-168.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12067194/)
    
    ### 3. May Improve Sleep Quality
    - Studies suggest that eating kiwi may improve sleep onset, duration, and efficiency.
    - [Lin, H. H., Tsai, P. S., Fang, S. C., & Liu, J. F. (2011). Effect of kiwifruit consumption on sleep quality in adults with sleep problems. *Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition*, 20(2), 169-174.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21669584/)
    
    ### 4. Heart Health Benefits
    - Kiwi may help lower blood pressure and reduce blood clotting, supporting cardiovascular health.
    - [Duttaroy, A. K., & J√∏rgensen, A. (2004). Effects of kiwi fruit consumption on platelet aggregation and plasma lipids in healthy human volunteers. *Platelets*, 15(5), 287-292.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15512737/)
    
    ### 5. Rich in Folate and Other Micronutrients
    - Folate is essential for cell growth and development, making kiwi a great choice for pregnant women.
    - [Ferguson, A. R., & Ferguson, L. R. (2003). Are kiwifruit really good for you? *Acta Horticulturae*, 610, 131-137.](https://www.actahort.org/books/610/610_16.htm)
